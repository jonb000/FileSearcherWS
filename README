Recursive file search engine, that will search for either
filenames or with content flag set, a matching string in
the file contents.

The searched for string is a regular expresses (regex) as
define by the Java Pattern class.  Pretty standard.

Command line arguments can be seen by executing the jar:
        $ java -jar FileSearcherWS.jar -h
with the jar file and lib tree in your local directory.


The program is currently available as a web start application
on the internet.  When running this URL, should 
your browser happen to be configured to download the .jnlp
file instead of execute it, just download it and then open 
the file for execution from your file browser.
