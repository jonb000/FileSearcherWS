Recursive file search engine, that will search for either
filenames or with content flag set, a matching string in
the file contents.

The searched for string is a regular expresses (regex) as
define by the Java Pattern class.  Pretty standard.

Command line arguments can be seen by executing the jar:
        $ java -jar FileSearcherWS.jar -h
with the jar file in your local directory.

The GUI can be invoked by double clicking on the jar in
your OS, or invoking from the command line with no
arguments, or by running the launch.jnlp file
        $ java -jar FileSearcherWS.jar

The program is currently available as a web start application
on the internet.  When running this URL, should 
your browser happen to be configured to download the .jnlp
file instead of execute it, just download it and then open 
the file for execution from your file browser.
